## Introduction

Every December, the programming community gathers for a collective ritual: [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Created by Eric Wastl, it is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles that releases a new challenge every day from December 1st through the 12th.

These aren't your typical "fix the bug" or "build an API" tasks. They are algorithmic challenges that require complex data structures, graph traversal, 3D geometry, cellular automata simulations, and pathfinding algorithms. Naturally, developers usually reach for general-purpose languages like Python, Rust, Go, or C++ to solve them.

### Why not SQL?

Asking a database to solve these problems is generally considered a mistake. Standard SQL is a declarative language designed for retrieving and aggregating relational data, not for imperative game loops or complex state management. It lacks native support for the data structures usually required for these puzzles (like stacks, queues, or trees), and attempting to solve them with standard JOINs usually leads to performance disasters or syntax errors. In short, solving Advent of Code in SQL is widely considered "impossible" - or at least, incredibly painful.

### The ClickHouse approach

At ClickHouse, we don't like the word "impossible." We believe that with the right tools, **everything** is a data problem. ClickHouse isn't just a fast OLAP database; it is a vectorized query engine with a massive library of analytical functions that can be ~~abused~~ bent to solve general-purpose computing problems.

To prove it, we decided to complete the 2025 Advent of Code unconventionally: using **pure ClickHouse SQL**.

### The rules

To ensure we didn't take any shortcuts, we imposed three strict rules on our solutions:

1. **Pure ClickHouse SQL only**: we allowed absolutely no User Defined Functions (UDFs), and specifically no *executable* UDFs that would allow us to "cheat" by shelling out to Python or Bash. If the query engine couldn't do it natively, we couldn't do it.
2. **Raw inputs only**: in Advent of Code, the input is often a messy text file. Sometimes a list of numbers, sometimes an ASCII art map, or a block of cryptic instructions. We were not allowed to pre-process this data. The solution query must accept the raw puzzle input string exactly as provided by the AoC challenge and parse it within the query.
3. **"Single query" constraint**: this is the hardest rule of all. We were not allowed to create tables, materialized views, or temporary tables to store intermediate state. The entire puzzle—from parsing the input, to solving Part 1, to solving the (often substantially more complex) Part 2—must be executed as a **single, atomic query**. This required us to rely heavily on CTEs to chain our logic together in one uninterrupted execution.

Below are the solutions for all 12 days of Advent of Code 2025, demonstrating how we turned "impossible" algorithmic challenges into pure ClickHouse SQL queries.

> Note: in order to comply with Advent of Code's distribution policy, the queries below use a wrapper `URL()` table to fetch the raw puzzle inputs without exposing them. The original query versions with handling for direct string inputs can be found in our [ClickHouse/TreeHouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse/TreeHouse) repository.

## Day 1: The Secret Entrance

**The Puzzle**: The elves have locked their secret entrance with a rotating dial safe. The puzzle involves simulating the movement of a dial labeled 0-99 based on a sequence of instructions like L68 (turn left 68 clicks) or R48 (turn right 48 clicks).

- **Part 1** asks for the final position of the dial after all rotations, starting from 50.
- **Part 2** requires a more complex simulation: counting exactly how many times the dial points to 0 *during* the entire process, including intermediate clicks as it rotates past zero multiple times.

**How we solved this in ClickHouse SQL:** We treated this simulation as a stream processing problem rather than a procedural loop. Since the state of the dial depends entirely on the history of moves, we can calculate the cumulative position for every single instruction at once. We parsed the directions into positive (Right) and negative (Left) integers, then used a window function to create a running total of steps. For Part 2, where we needed to detect "zero crossings," we compared the current running total with the previous row's total to determine if the dial passed 0.

**Implementation details:**

1. [`sum() OVER (...)`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/window-functions): We used standard SQL window functions to maintain the "running total" of the dial's position. By normalizing the left/right directions into positive/negative values, we tracked the cumulative position for every row in a single pass.
```sql
sum(normalized_steps) OVER (ORDER BY instruction_id) AS raw_position
```
1. [`lagInFrame`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/window-functions): To count how many times we passed zero, we needed to know where the dial started before the current rotation. We used `lagInFrame` to peek at the position from the previous row. This allowed us to compare the start and end points of a rotation and mathematically determine if 0 fell between them.

**Full Solution:**

## Day 2: The Gift Shop

**The Puzzle**: You are helping clean up a gift shop database filled with invalid product IDs. The input is a list of ID ranges (e.g., 11-22, 95-115).

- **Part 1** defines an invalid ID as one composed of a sequence repeated exactly twice (like 1212 or 55).
- **Part 2** expands this to any sequence repeated *at least* twice (like 123123123 or 11111). The goal is to sum up all invalid IDs found within the given ranges.

**How we solved this in ClickHouse SQL**: Instead of writing a loop to iterate through numbers, we leaned on ClickHouse's ability to "explode" data. We took the compact input ranges (like 11-22) and instantly expanded them into millions of individual rows - one for every integer in the range. Once we had a row for every potential ID, we converted them to strings and applied array functions to check for the repeating patterns in parallel.

**Implementation details**:

1. [`arrayJoin`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/array-functions#arrayjoin): This function is our staple for generating rows. We used `range(start, end)` to create an array of integers for each input line, and `arrayJoin` to explode that array into separate rows. This made filtering for invalid IDs a simple `WHERE` clause operation.
```sql
SELECT arrayJoin(range(bounds[1], bounds[2] + 1)) AS number
```
1. [`arrayExists`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/array-functions#arrayExists): For Part 2, we had to check if any substring length (from 1 up to the string length) formed a repeating pattern. We used `arrayExists` with a lambda function to check every possible substring length. If the lambda returns 1 for any length, the ID is flagged.
```sql
arrayExists(
    x -> (string_length % x = 0) AND (repeat(substring(..., x), ...) = number_string),
    range(1, string_length)
)
```

**Full Solution:**

```sql

## Day 3: The Lobby

**The Puzzle**: You need to jumpstart an escalator using banks of batteries, where each bank is a string of digits (e.g., 987654321).

- **Part 1** asks you to pick exactly two batteries (digits) to form the largest possible 2-digit number, preserving their original relative order.
- **Part 2** scales this up: pick exactly 12 batteries to form the largest possible 12-digit number. This becomes a greedy optimization problem - you always want the largest available digit that still leaves enough digits after it to complete the sequence.

**How we solved this in ClickHouse SQL**: Part 1 was a straightforward string manipulation, but Part 2 required us to maintain state while iterating through the digits. We needed to track how many digits we still needed to find and our current position in the string so we wouldn't pick digits out of order. We implemented this greedy algorithm directly in SQL using `arrayFold`, which allowed us to iterate through the digits while carrying an accumulator tuple containing our current constraints.

**Implementation details**:

1. [`arrayFold`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/array-functions#arrayFold): We used this higher-order function to implement `reduce()` -style logic. Our accumulator stored a tuple: `(digits_remaining, current_position, accumulated_value)`. For every step of the fold, we calculated the best valid digit to pick next and updated the state tuple accordingly.
```sql
arrayFold(
    (accumulator, current_element) -> ( ... ), -- Update logic
    digits,
    (num_digits_needed, 0, 0) -- Initial state
)
```
1. [`ngrams`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/splitting-merging-functions#ngrams): To process the string of digits as an array, we used `ngrams(string, 1)`. While typically used for text analysis, here it served as a convenient way to split a string into an array of single characters, which we then cast to integers for the `arrayFold` operation.

**Full Solution:**

```sql

## Day 4: The Printing Department

**The Puzzle**: The elves need to break through a wall of paper rolls. The puzzle is a variation of Conway's Game of Life. You are given a grid where `@` represents a roll of paper.

- **Part 1** defines a rule: a roll can be "accessed" (removed) if it has fewer than 4 neighbors. You count how many rolls fit this criteria initially.
- **Part 2** asks to simulate this process recursively. Removing a roll might open up access to others. You need to keep removing accessible rolls until the system stabilizes, then count the total removed.

**How we solved this in ClickHouse SQL**: Since this problem required iterative simulation where each step depended on the previous one, we used a Recursive CTE. We represented the grid as a set of (x, y) coordinates. In each recursive step, we performed a self-join to count the neighbors for every point. We filtered the list to keep only the points that "survived" (had >= 4 neighbors), implicitly removing the others. We continued this recursion until the count of points stopped changing.

**Implementation details**:

1. [`WITH RECURSIVE`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/statements/select/with#recursive-queries): We used the standard SQL recursive CTE to handle the graph traversal. The base case selected all initial paper roll positions. The recursive step filtered that set down based on neighbor counts.
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE recursive_convergence AS (
    -- Base case: all points
    UNION ALL
    -- Recursive step: keep points with >= 4 neighbors
    SELECT ... HAVING countIf(...) >= 4
)
```
1. [`argMin`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/aggregate-functions/reference/argmin): To find the exact moment the simulation stabilized, we tracked the point count at every depth of the recursion. We used `argMin(point_count, depth)` to retrieve the count of remaining points exactly at the minimum depth where the count stopped changing.

**Full Solution:**

## Day 5: The Cafeteria

**The Puzzle**: The elves have an inventory problem involving lists of "fresh" ID ranges (e.g., 3-5, 10-14).

- **Part 1** asks how many specific item IDs fall into any of the fresh ranges.
- **Part 2** asks for the total count of unique integers covered by the fresh ranges (the union of all intervals). For example, if you have ranges 1-5 and 3-7, the union is 1-7 (size 7), not 1-5 + 3-7 (size 10).

**How we solved this in ClickHouse SQL**: This is a classic interval intersection problem. While Part 1 was a simple filter, Part 2 required merging overlapping intervals. Merging intervals can be mathematically complex to implement manually, but we utilized a specialized ClickHouse aggregation function designed exactly for this purpose, turning a complex geometric algorithm into a one-liner.

**Implementation details**:

1. [`intervalLengthSum`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/aggregate-functions/reference/intervallengthsum): We used this specialized aggregate function to calculate the total length of the union of intervals. It automatically handles overlapping and nested ranges, saving us from writing complex merging logic.
```sql
SELECT intervalLengthSum(range_tuple.1, range_tuple.2) AS solution
```
1. [`arrayExists`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/array-functions#arrayExists): For Part 1, we used arrayExists to check if a specific ID fell within *any* of the valid ranges in the array. This allowed us to perform the check efficiently without exploding the ranges into billions of individual rows.

**Full Solution:**

```sql
1
-- Define puzzle input
2
WITH input_wrapper AS (SELECT trimRight(raw_blob,'\n') AS input FROM aoc.input5),
3

4
-- Split input into two sections

## Day 6: The Trash Compactor

**The Puzzle**: You find a math worksheet with problems arranged in columns.

- **Part 1** interprets the input as columns of numbers separated by spaces. You need to sum or multiply the numbers in each column based on the operator at the bottom.
- **Part 2** reveals the input is written "right-to-left" in columns, where digits of a single number are stacked vertically. You must re-parse the grid to reconstruct the numbers, group them by blank columns, and apply the operators.

**How we solved this in ClickHouse SQL**: This puzzle was all about parsing and array manipulation. We treated the input text as a 2D matrix of characters. To switch from the row-based text file to the column-based math problems, we essentially performed a "matrix transposition." We converted the rows of text into arrays of characters, "rotated" them to process columns, and then used array functions to reconstruct the numbers and apply the math operations.

**Implementation details**:

1. [`splitByWhitespace`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/splitting-merging-functions#splitByWhitespace): In Part 1, we used this function to parse the "horizontal" representation. It automatically handled the variable spacing between columns, which would have tripped up simple string splitting.
2. [`arrayProduct`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/array-functions#arrayProduct): Since ClickHouse lacks a standard `product()` aggregate function, we mapped our columns to arrays of integers and used `arrayProduct` to calculate the multiplication results.
```sql
toInt64(arrayProduct(
    arrayMap(x -> toInt64(x), arraySlice(column, 1, length(column) - 1))
))
```
1. [`arraySplit`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/array-functions#arraySplit): For Part 2, after extracting the raw digits, we needed to group them into valid expressions. We used `arraySplit` to break the large array into chunks whenever we encountered an operator column, effectively separating the mathematical problems.

**Full Solution:**

```sql
1
-- Define puzzle input

## Day 7: The Teleporter Lab

**The Puzzle**: You are analyzing a tachyon beam in a grid.

- **Part 1** simulates a beam moving downwards. When it hits a splitter `^`, it splits into two beams (left and right). You count the total splits.
- **Part 2** introduces a "quantum many-worlds" twist: instead of splitting the beam, the universe splits. You need to calculate the total number of active "timelines" (paths) at the bottom of the grid.

**How we solved this in ClickHouse SQL**: Simulating individual paths would have caused an exponential explosion. Instead, we approached this like a wave propagation simulation (similar to calculating Pascal's triangle). We processed the grid row-by-row using `arrayFold`. For each row, we maintained a map of "active world counts" at each column position and calculated how the counts flowed into the next row based on the splitters.

**Implementation details**:

1. [`arrayFold`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/array-functions#arrayFold): We used `arrayFold` to implement the row-by-row simulation state machine. We carried a complex state object - `(left_boundary, right_boundary, worlds_map, part1_counter)` - and updated it for each row of the grid.
2. [`sumMap`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/aggregate-functions/reference/summap): To handle beams merging (e.g., a left branch and a right branch meeting at the same spot), we used `sumMap`. This allowed us to aggregate values for identical keys in our world map, easily combining the counts of "timelines" converging on a single coordinate.
```sql
arrayReduce('sumMap', arrayMap(position -> map(...), ...))
```

## Day 8: The Playground

**The Puzzle**: The elves are connecting 3D electrical junction boxes.

- **Part 1** asks to connect the 1000 closest pairs of points and analyze the resulting circuit sizes (connected components).
- **Part 2** asks to keep connecting the closest points until *all* boxes form a single giant circuit (a Minimum Spanning Tree problem).

**How we solved this in ClickHouse SQL**: This is a graph theory problem requiring a disjoint-set (union-find) approach. We generated all possible edges between points and sorted them by distance. Then, we used `arrayFold` to iterate through the edges, merging sets of points into connected components whenever an edge bridged two previously separate groups.

**Implementation details**:

1. [`L2Distance`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/distance-functions#L2Distance): We used ClickHouse's native `L2Distance` function to efficiently calculate the Euclidean distance between 3D coordinates `[x, y, z]`, allowing us to sort the potential connections by length.
2. [`runningAccumulate`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/other-functions#runningAccumulate): For Part 2, we needed to know when we had seen enough unique points to form a single circuit. Instead of running a slow `DISTINCT` count on every row, we used `uniqCombinedState` to create a compact sketch of unique elements, and `runningAccumulate` to merge these sketches row-by-row, providing a running count of unique points efficiently.
```sql
runningAccumulate(points_state) AS unique_points_seen

## Day 9: The Movie Theater

**The Puzzle**: The theater floor is a grid with some red tiles.

- **Part 1** asks for the largest area rectangle formed using two red tiles as opposite corners.
- **Part 2** adds a constraint: the rectangle must fit entirely inside the loop formed by all the red/green tiles.

**How we solved this in ClickHouse SQL**: We treated this as a geometry problem rather than a grid search. We constructed polygons representing the candidate rectangles and the boundary loop. By converting the bounding boxes into "rings," we could use ClickHouse's native geometry functions to calculate areas and check for containment.

**Implementation details**:

1. [`polygonAreaCartesian`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/geo/polygons#polygonareacartesian): We avoided manual width/height calculations by constructing polygon objects for our rectangles and using `polygonAreaCartesian` to compute their area directly.
2. [`polygonsWithinCartesian`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/geo/polygons#polygonswithincartesian): To check if a rectangle fit inside the loop, we used this containment function. We applied a clever trick here: because geometric functions can be tricky about points shared exactly on an edge, we constructed a slightly **inset** version of the candidate rectangle (shrunk by 0.01 units). This ensured the containment check strictly validated that the rectangle fit *inside* the boundary polygon without edge alignment errors.
```sql
-- Create slightly inset test bounds (0.01 units inside)
(least(x1, x2) + 0.01, least(y1, y2) + 0.01) AS bottom_left, ...
polygonsWithinCartesian(test_bounds, all_points_ring)
```

## Day 10: The Factory

**The Puzzle**: You need to configure factory machines by pressing buttons.

- **Part 1** involves toggling lights (XOR logic) to match a pattern.
- **Part 2** involves incrementing "joltage" counters to reach large target integers using the fewest button presses.

**How we solved this in ClickHouse SQL**: For Part 1, the search space was small enough that we could use brute-force enumeration. We generated every possible button combination and checked it using bitmasks. Part 2 required a smarter approach. We implemented a custom recursive halving algorithm in SQL. We iteratively subtracted button effects and "halved" the remaining target values, reducing the large target numbers down to zero step-by-step.

**Implementation details**:

1. [`bitTest`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/bit-functions#bitTest) and [`bitCount`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/bit-functions#bitCount): We treated button combinations as binary integers. `bitTest` allowed us to check if a specific button was pressed in a combination, and `bitCount` gave us the total number of presses (the cost).
2. [`ARRAY JOIN`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/select/array-join): To generate the search space for Part 1, we created a range of integers (0 to 2^N) and used `ARRAY JOIN` to explode them into rows. This created a row for every possible permutation of button presses.
```sql
ARRAY JOIN range(0, toUInt32(pow(2, num_buttons)))
```

**Full Solution:**

```sql

## Day 11: The Reactor

**The Puzzle**: You are debugging a reactor control graph.

- **Part 1** asks to count all distinct paths from `you` to `out`.
- **Part 2** asks to count paths from `svr` to `out` that satisfy a constraint: they must visit both intermediate nodes `dac` and `fft`.

**How we solved this in ClickHouse SQL**: We solved this using a Recursive CTE to traverse the graph. To handle the constraint in Part 2, we carried "visited flags" in our recursion state. As we traversed the graph, we updated these boolean flags whenever we hit a checkpoint node. At the end, we simply filtered for paths where both flags were true.

**Implementation details**:

1. [`cityHash64`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/hash-functions#cityHash64): String comparisons can be slow in large recursive joins. We converted the node names (like `svr`, `dac`) into deterministic 64-bit integers using `cityHash64`. This made the join operations significantly faster and reduced memory usage.
```sql
cityHash64('svr') AS svr_node
```
1. **State Tracking**: We added boolean columns to our recursive table to track state. This allowed us to solve the "must visit X and Y" constraint in a single pass without needing complex post-processing.
```sql
paths.visited_dac OR (edges.to_node = kn.dac_node) AS visited_dac
```

**Full Solution:**

## Day 12: Christmas Tree Farm

**The Puzzle**: Elves need to pack irregular presents (defined by `#` grids) into rectangular regions. This looks like a complex 2D bin-packing problem. However, the puzzle input allows for a heuristic shortcut: checking if the *total area* of the presents is less than or equal to the *total area* of the region is sufficient.

**How we solved this in ClickHouse SQL**: Since we could solve this with a volume check, our solution focused on parsing. We converted the ASCII art shapes into binary grids (arrays of 1s and 0s) and calculated the area (count of 1s) for each. We then multiplied the requested quantity of each present by its area and compared the sum to the region's total size.

**Implementation details**:

1. [`replaceRegexpAll`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/string-replace-functions#replaceRegexpAll): We used regex replacement to turn the visual `#` characters into `1` and `.` into `0`. This transformed the "art" into computable binary strings that we could parse into arrays.
2. [`arraySum`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/array-functions#arraySum): We used the lambda version of `arraySum` to perform a "dot product" operation. We multiplied the volume of each present by its area and summed the results in a single, clean expression.
```sql
arraySum(
    (volume, area) -> volume * area,
    requested_shape_volumes,
    areas_per_shape
)
```

**Full Solution:**

```sql

-- Split input into sections

## Conclusion

The fact that we successfully solved all 12 of these puzzles using pure ClickHouse SQL demonstrates just how versatile our query engine truly is. This is all made possible because ClickHouse includes a massive standard library of built-in functions that bridge the gap between SQL and general-purpose programming. Throughout this challenge, we utilized over a dozen different [String Functions](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/string-functions) alongside the [format](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/table-functions/format) table function to manipulate messy inputs into workable datasets. We relied heavily on [Array Functions](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/array-functions) like [`arrayMap`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/array-functions#arrayMap) and [`arrayProduct`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/array-functions#arrayProduct), but the real heroes were [`arrayReduce`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/array-functions#arrayReduce) and [`arrayFold`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/array-functions#arrayFold), which allowed us to implement complex functional programming logic and maintain state across iterations. When combined with native [Recursive CTEs](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/select/with#recursive-cte) for pathfinding, [Distance Functions](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/distance-functions) for 3D geometry, [Polygon Functions](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/functions/geo/polygons) for spatial analysis, and [Bitwise Operations](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/bit-functions) for logic gates, ClickHouse behaves less like a database and more like a high-performance vector computation engine.

Due to our self-imposed constraints, these SQL solutions may not be as computationally optimal as implementations written in "real" programming languages like Rust or Python, but they nevertheless yield the exact same results. This experiment proves that when you have the right tools, problems that seem "impossible" in SQL become just another interesting data challenge for ClickHouse. You can view the full set of solution queries in our [ClickHouse/TreeHouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse/TreeHouse) repository.
